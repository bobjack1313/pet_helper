Basically, never commit to the main branch unless specified.

Create a new branch for each sprint. 
For each issue in the backlog, create a separate branch from the sprint branch. Name that branch
with either the backlog issue and your name or a very brief description with your name.

Example branch name:
issue34bobjack
issue21jinyu
bugfix22bobjack

Once the item is placed in review, it will be analyzed, then merged into the sprint branch.
Afterward the issue will be considered Done.

Remember to always get a fresh pull from the sprint branch or else you may have merging nightmares.
