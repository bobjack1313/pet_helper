What to include in your commit files

You should not add the gradle directory to a git commit. Here's why:
Reasons to Exclude:
Generated Files: The gradle directory contains files generated by Gradle during the build process. These files are not part of your project's source code and can be regenerated as needed.  
Bloated Repository: Adding generated files increases the size of your repository unnecessarily.  
Potential Conflicts: Including generated files can lead to merge conflicts when multiple developers are working on the project.  
Environment-Specific: Some files within the gradle directory might be specific to your development environment, making them irrelevant to other developers.  
What to Include Instead:
gradlew and gradlew.bat: These wrapper scripts allow other developers to build your project without having to install Gradle themselves.
gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar: This JAR file is required by the wrapper scripts.
build.gradle and settings.gradle: These files define your project's build configuration and dependencies.



How to Exclude:
Add the following lines to your .gitignore file:
Code

.gradle/
build/
