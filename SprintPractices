Sprint Practices and Expectations

During a sprint, the primary objective is to move all items
from the left side of the board to the right side. To contribute,
you are expected to review the board and assign a task to yourself.
Please note that multiple team members can collaborate on a single task.
Once you have selected a task, move it to the "In Progress" section.

Upon completing the task, kindly add a comment in the task description
detailing the work you accomplished. When you commit your work,
you will see a hash number, such as: 123cff123asf125f10f.
Please copy this hash number and paste it into the comment section
of the task. This will link the issue to the corresponding work.

After committing your changes and completing the task, move the item
to the "Review" column. The Scrum Master or another designated person
will then review the submitted code for completeness and compliance.
If everything is satisfactory, the task will be moved to "Done" and
merged into the development branch.

If a task is too complex, you may break it into smaller components.
In such cases, please create a new issue, describe the required work,
and include a link to the original issue in the description. Move this
new issue into the sprint, but do not assign it a story point, as
this will impact the sprint burndown. Additionally, avoid modifying
story points during an active sprint, as this too can affect the
burndown chart.

Thank you, and happy coding!
