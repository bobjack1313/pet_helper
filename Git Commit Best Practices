https://gist.github.com/luismts/495d982e8c5b1a0ced4a57cf3d93cf60

Basics

Write something basic about the commit you are adding. The line should be under 50 characters. It should start with a Capital letter. There should be no punctuation

Example commit titles:

Completion for issue #24

Resolution for issue #24

Fix for issue #24

Solution for issue #24

Added new library for issue #24

Created new views for issue #24

Fixed navigation bug in issue #24



Description:
Optional

This can describe the work done. 

Example:
I finished the work on the new view. Testing still needs to be completed. The views are not connected to any database models. Only stubs.
